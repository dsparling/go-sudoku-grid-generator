go-sudoku-grid-generator
========================

A simple sudoku generator written in Go

go-sudoku-grid-generator is a simple port based on the Java-based
[SodokuGridGenerator](https://github.com/valcol/SodokuGridGenerator)
by [valcol](https://github.com/valcol).
which appears to be similar but a simpler version of the C-based
[sudoku-generator](https://github.com/xkaycee/sudoku-generator)
by [xkaycee](https://github.com/xkaycee)

Bugs/Limitations
----------------

Solutions don't appear to be unique and the puzzle diffculty logic was
just copied from the project I ported from. All in all, this was just
a bit of fun and not intende to a production ready Sudoku generator.
I'll probably make updates as I learn more about Sudoku or
create an entirely new project.
